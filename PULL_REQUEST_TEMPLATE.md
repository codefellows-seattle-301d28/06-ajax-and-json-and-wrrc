#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Dean and Jordan paired together. It took about an hour and a half**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. Looked over and handled and reviews and comments to get an understanding of what we had to do
  2. Planned how we would handle the localstorage data with our if else statement, then we determined that if localstorage existed we had to pull the data from localstorage
  3. Then we worked out how to put the data in localstorage then ran the data from the file directly, finally we changed the placement of the initindexpage function so that it wouldn't run until all the data was loaded

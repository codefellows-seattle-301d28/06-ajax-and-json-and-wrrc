## Overview
This application is built to populate a blog with articles by means of a faux server. It also allows for the creation of articles and subsequent population of them on the page.

## Getting Started
Any user looking to get this running would need to fork or clone the repository, open it in their favorite code editor (if they are looking to modify the article content), and then simply run their own live-server or open in their favorite browser to view and interact with the page.

## Architecture
In this application we utilized the languages of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and the libraries of:
jQuery https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery
Handlebars (see below)
